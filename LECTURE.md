# Design Activity - Kickstarter

![kickstarter](http://dailygenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/kick-start-this.jpg)

Today we're going to practice doing an application design - deciding how our models, routes, and views should behave before we start coding. You'll be working in groups to design [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.org), a website which lets artists, musicians, inventors, filmmakers, and others post project ideas. Users can fund the project in exchange for a variety of rewards. 

### Determine the Story
First, browse Kickstarter and tell the story of the app. How would you describe how the user interacts with the application? For example: "First, a user will browse projects. Projects have different backers, etc."

### Designing the Schema

How many different nouns were in your story? Each of those nouns becomes a model in your application. Make a class diagram of the models your app will need and the relationship between those models. Many developers use tools such as [Gliffy](http://www.gliffy.com) for this, but you can also use a whiteboard or chart paper. In the example below, we can visually see that a customer has many orders.

### Routing your Routes

Next, list out the different routes your application will need. For example, what route should show me all of the projects? What about the project with an id of 50?

### Wireframing the Views

Once you've determined your routes, start wireframing the views that will correspond to those routes. What does the index page look like? What about the project page? Don't be afraid to make changes to Kickstarter if you think things could be better laid out.

### Going Further

+ Once you've finished, take a look at the sites below - how could you adapt your designs to fit the following applicaitons?
