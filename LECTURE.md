# Design Activity - Civic Tech

## Motivation/Why Should You Care?

Most of the programming we've done so far has been "bottom-up", meaning we're changing how our application works based on the problems we encounter. This lets us start coding very quickly and is great for learning, but it would be nice to get a clearer picture of how our apps should function before we started coding. Today, we'll get some practice doing "top-down" designs. 

## Lesson Plan

### Intro

+ So far, we've been using our coding "super powers" to build awesome social media websites. There are many other sites which are changing the world which use the same patterns and technologies.
+ [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.org), a website which lets artists, musicians, inventors, filmmakers, and others post project ideas. Users can fund the project in exchange for a variety of rewards. 
+ Today, we'll be working in groups to design our own version of Kickstarter. We won't actually be writing any code - instead, we'll be mapping out the models, relationships, routes, and views 
+ First, make a class diagram of the models your app will need and the relationship between those models. Many developers use tools such as [Gliffy](http://www.gliffy.com) for this, but you can also use a whiteboard or chart paper.
+ Next, list out the different routes your application will need. For example, what route should show me all of the projects? What about the project with an id of 50?
+ Once you've determined your routes, start wireframing the views that will correspond to those routes. What does the index page look like? What about the project page? Don't be afraid to make changes to Kickstarter if you think things could be better laid out. 
+ Finally, come up with a flowchart outlining how the user will interact with the application. What's the first thing they should click on when they get to the home page? What about after logging in? How could you make the flow even better? 

### Discussions

+ Once you've finished, take some time to discuss as a whole class. What were some interesting decisions that people had to make? Why did you make those decisions? 
+ Show students other civic-minded apps which would have similar design.
